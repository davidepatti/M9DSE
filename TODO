TODO:

current version:
- clean code and make it more modular
- set benchmark directory
- add new mem parameters allowed by m5
- use directly the envrc script of matlab instead of environment.h
- fuzzy_approx works properly only with GA...
- add population 2 among GA parameters


DONE:
- (REPLACED) implement a MAX_RETRY mechanism in save/restore simulation to avoid
  undefined blocking of exploration process. 
  SOLUTION --> continue on failure option. Retry would be useless when
  compilation error occours, since they will simply happens again...
- move subspace to settings, remove edit
- Logging of M9DSE explorer activities
- add compiler space exploration
- add multi-cluster support
- Avoid (optional) the creation of matlab log file
- GA Causality
- Uniform the base path by calling get_base_dir()
- Setting the average consumption of main memory access ( L2 Misses * Emm)
- make the file name hmdes2 variable
- signal (*) for configurations that have been estimated works randomly
- add compilation profile choice
- fix fuzzy option, write enabled instead of 0,1,2
- Scale Vdd to 1.3
- 10% on access time
- Save information on the subspace considered directly in the info file of each
  exploration ;
- append_simulations(...), should not add duplicate simulations
- get_pareto3d(...) , the outermost for-loop goes up to size-1, probably
  because the original version only compared each one with the next;
- getPareto3d(...), identical repeated simulations dominate each other and thus
  disappear!
- Intercept resimulation of the same subspace (e.g. crossmerging with a cluster
  whose parameters are all stationary)
- Batch of predetermined consecutive explorations
- Changing the exploration space via software
- Elimination of matlab output during exploration, increased speed?
- Arrangement so that they are saved every few instead of always being in memory
  until the end of the simulation -> problems with more complex benchmarks
  

DEPRECATED:
- Set the creation of references in memory via software.
- Use separate VGS and power fields in the Simulation class
- Allow M9DSE to be used remotely!
- Resume explorations
